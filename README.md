# Plant-Disease-Detection

## Introduction 

In this given project various plant samples are collected from different parts of the states with the help of University
then documented in their respective folder. Then they were analysed using various image processing techniques .After that
Convolution Neural Network was used to predict the given class of plant disease

## Data Description

The data set consists of four class of plant and the images of the diseased leaf

## Algorithim used 

A Sequencial Model was initilaised then 
-> A convolution layer was added
-> A pooling layer a added
-> the network is flattened
-> layer  are densed at the end

Finally compiled using adam optimizer, 
Loss is calculated using crossentropy 
And acciracy using accuracy metrics

## Result

Finally the result is formulated and the model is saved in a h5 file

### Accuracy
The model has a accuracy of 89%
